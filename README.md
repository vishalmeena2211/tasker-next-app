# YouseAI Assessment

This repository contains the code for the YouseAI Assessment project. The project is divided into two main parts: the frontend and the backend.

## Frontend

The frontend of this project is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework that enables server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications.

## Backend

The backend is developed using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
